How do I download and run this thing?
=====================================
The quick and simple solution is to do the following at the shell:

  cd ~/
  wget https://raw.github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/master/oab-java6.sh -O oab-java6.sh
  chmod +x oab-java6.sh
  sudo ./oab-java6.sh -k [jre|jdk]

How it works
============
This script is merely a wrapper for most excllent Debian packaging 
scripts prepared by Janusz Dziemidowicz.

  - https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6

The basic execution steps are:
  - Remove, my now disabled, Java PPA 'ppa:flexiondotorg/java'.
  - Install the tools required to build the packages.
  - Create download and build caches under '/var/local/oab'.
  - Download the i586 and x64 Java 6 install binaries. Yes, both are required.
  - Clone the build scripts from https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6
  - Build all the Java 6u30 packages applicable to your system.
  - Install the packages that were just built.

What gets installed?
====================
If you elect to install the JRE the following packages are installed:

  * sun-java6-bin
  * sun-java6-jre
  * sun-java6-fonts

If you elect to install the JDK this following packages are installed,
in addition to those from the JRE above.

  * sun-java6-jdk
  * sun-java6-source

The Java browser plugin is installed, **but only if a supported web browser
is already installed**. This is a safe guard to prevent servers from 
installing a web browser and all its dependencies.

  * sun-java6-plugin

What is not installed?
======================
When electing to install the JDK the Java Development Kit demos and
examples, 'sun-java6-demo' and the Java DB distribution of Apache
Derby 'sun-java6-javadb' are not installed by default. Should you
require those packages, execute the following:

  sudo dpkg -i /var/local/oab/deb/sun-java6-demo_6.30-3~oneiric1_amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i /var/local/oab/deb/sun-java6-javadb_6.30-3~oneiric1_all.deb

What is 'oab'?
==============
Because, O.A.B! ;-)
