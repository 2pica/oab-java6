If you want to see what this is script is doing while it is running then execute
the following from another shell:

  tail -f ./oab-java6.sh.log

Usage

  sudo ./oab-java6.sh

Optional parameters
  -h : This help

How do I download and run this thing?
=====================================
Like this.

  cd ~/
  wget https://raw.github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/master/oab-java6.sh -O oab-java6.sh
  chmod +x oab-java6.sh
  sudo ./oab-java6.sh

How it works
============
This script is merely a wrapper for the most excllent Debian packaging
scripts prepared by Janusz Dziemidowicz.

  - https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6

The basic execution steps are:

  - Remove, my now disabled, Java PPA 'ppa:flexiondotorg/java'.
  - Install the tools required to build the Java packages.
  - Create download cache in '/var/local/oab/pkg'.
  - Download the i586 and x64 Java 6 install binaries from Oracle. Yes, both are required.
  - Clone the build scripts from https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6
  - Build the Java 6u30 packages applicable to your system.
  - Create local 'apt' repository in '/var/local/oab/deb' for the newly built Java Packages

What gets installed?
====================
Nothing!

This script will no longer try and directly install or upgrade any Java
packages, instead a local 'apt' repository is created that hosts locally
built Java packages applicable to your system. It is up to you to install
or upgrade the Java packages you require using 'apt-get', 'aptitude' or
'synaptic', etc. For example, once this script has been run you can simply
install the JRE by executing the following from a shell.

  sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

Or if you already have the "official" Ubuntu packages installed then you
can upgrade by executing the folowing from a shell.

  sudo apt-get upgrade

The local 'apt' repository is just that, **local**. It is not accessible
remotely and oab-java6.sh will never enable that capability to ensure
compliance with Oracle's asinine license requirements.

What is 'oab'?
==============
Because, O.A.B! ;-)
